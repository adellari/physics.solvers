##An exploration of Physics Solvers applied to the Dynamics of Compressable Fluid Flow

Contains algorithms for 2D fluid flow, with GPU implementations of Jacobi and Gauss Seidel Projection solvers.
Currently focused on studying and implementing different multi-grid cycle configurations. 

In my greater ambitions for this project, where I eventually move the algorithms to 3D, I've added my gtlf to sdf implementation for (eventual) dynamic interactions.
